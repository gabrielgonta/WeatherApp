# 🌤️ Progressive Weather App

## Description

Welcome to Weather App - Fullstack Vue Version! 🎉 
Progressive Weather App is a modern, sleek weather forecast application built with Vue.js and designed to work seamlessly across devices. As a Progressive Web App (PWA), it ensures a fast, responsive, and offline-capable experience, allowing users to check the weather anytime, anywhere. The app fetches real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap, making it reliable and up-to-date.

## Security

With Firebase security rules, your account, data, and files won’t fall into the wrong hands.

### How it works

Firebase security rules act as a barrier between your data and malicious users.

Firebase security rules work by matching a pattern to database paths and then applying custom conditions to allow data access at those paths. Every Firebase feature rule has a path-matching component and a conditional statement that allows read or write access. Rules are defined for each Firebase feature in this application to ensure that only you can access your account information.
